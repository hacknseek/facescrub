facescrub
=========
This is a fork version from faceteam/facescrub(https://github.com/faceteam/facescrub),
created for Python3 compatibility

`$ python downlaod_py3.py`

### Original Readme Below

Download dataset from http://vintage.winklerbros.net/facescrub.html

simply rum `python download.py`, all images are downloaded under `download`.

### Notice

Since I want to vertify the image and extract face region from the images, opencv-python package needed. If you are on Windows, this [url](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) can be very helpful to install packages.
